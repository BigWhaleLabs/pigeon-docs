# App Integrations

Pigeon's architecture is designed for seamless integration with DeFi protocols, apps, and platforms across the ecosystem. We continuously expand our toolkit to bring new capabilities directly into your chat interface.

## How Integrations Work

When we integrate a platform, you get:

- **Natural Language Access**: Interact with the protocol using plain English
- **Unified Context**: Combined with your portfolio, positions, and preferences
- **Pigeon Code Support**: Automate actions and monitoring via [Pigeon Code](pigeon-code.md)
- **Cross-Platform Synergy**: Combine with other tools for sophisticated strategies

## Featured Integrations

[Hypesino](https://hypesino.com) is a decentralized casino built on Hyperliquid. Through Pigeon, you can:

- Play casino games directly from chat
- Track your gaming history and statistics
- Set responsible gaming limits

```
"Play a round on Hypesino"

```
