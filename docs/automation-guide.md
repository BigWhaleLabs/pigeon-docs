# Automation Guide

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **BETA DISCLAIMER**  
> Automations are currently in **BETA**. While we apply layered safeguards, validation, and defensive design, an automation may still: (a) misinterpret intent, (b) miss edge conditions, (c) produce incomplete or unexpected outputs, or (d) temporarily fail or lag under load. **Do not rely on an automation as a sole source of truth for critical financial decisions.** You retain full responsibility for monitoring outputs and outcomes. Treat early runs as observation / calibration phases. Start with low‚Äërisk, read‚Äëonly monitoring before enabling any action-oriented logic. No guarantees of correctness, continuity, latency, or fitness for a particular purpose. This is **NOT financial, trading, or investment advice.** By using automations you acknowledge these limitations and agree to actively supervise their behavior.

Pigeon's automation engine transforms plain‚Äëlanguage intents into continuously operating autonomous monitoring and decision loops. Instead of brittle, hand‚Äëwritten scripts, you get adaptive, self‚Äëvalidating automations that compound insight over time while staying operator-light and risk-aware. This guide explains how to leverage that capability effectively (without exposing any sensitive implementation internals).

## How Automation Works

### High-Level Architecture

1. **Request Creation**: You describe what you want automated in natural language
2. **AI Processing**: Our AI system creates a custom automation tailored to your request
3. **Quality Assurance**: The automation goes through rigorous testing to ensure reliability
4. **Secure Execution**: Your automation runs in a protected environment
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: The system executes your automation on schedule and sends notifications

### Why Automation Generation Takes Time

**Strategic Generation Window (‚âà5‚Äì30 minutes)**

The delay is intentional. We are not assembling a template; we are synthesizing a durable autonomous asset. The platform performs a layered transformation pipeline that prioritizes resilience, signal quality, and long‚Äëhorizon operability over instant gratification.

**üß† Intent Decomposition & Alignment**  
Your natural‚Äëlanguage request is parsed into a structured objective profile, disambiguating metrics, triggers, constraints, and notification semantics. Ambiguity reduction here materially lowers downstream failure modes.

**üîÅ Iterative Synthesis Loop**  
Multiple candidate strategies are explored and stress‚Äëtested against hypothetical edge conditions (volatility spikes, null data, stale sources, sparse liquidity, rate anomalies). Only stable patterns advance.

**üîí Defensive Hardening Layer**  
The system applies policy, safety, and misuse guards plus resource envelope checks. This ensures automations remain well‚Äëbehaved even as market regimes shift.

**ÔøΩ Reliability Scoring & Convergence**  
Each candidate is evaluated through an internal scoring rubric focused on determinism, graceful degradation, and notification quality. Subthreshold variants are refined or discarded until convergence is reached.

**‚öôÔ∏è Contextual Optimization**  
Runtime cadence, data access strategy, and notification density are tuned so the automation is informative without being noisy or wasteful.

**What This Yields**
- ‚úÖ **Durability**: Designed to run unattended for extended periods
- ‚úÖ **Lower Operational Drag**: Fewer false positives and manual resets
- ‚úÖ **Signal Quality**: Higher relevance per delivered notification
- ‚úÖ **Defensibility**: Harder to replicate than copy‚Äëpaste scripts

**While You Wait**
- Your request sits in a managed queue‚Äîno need to stay online
- You‚Äôre notified automatically the moment it activates
- No interim action required; the platform handles orchestration end‚Äëto‚Äëend

The generation window is a one‚Äëtime upfront cost that produces compounding leverage: a higher‚Äëtrust autonomous process that keeps delivering value long after creation.

### The AI System

Our automation engine features advanced AI that:
- Understands complex natural language requests
- Creates reliable, autonomous automations
- Ensures security and stability through comprehensive validation
- Optimizes performance for continuous operation

## Getting Started with Automation

### Creating Your First Automation

To create an automation, you need to specify:

1. **What to automate** - A clear description of what you want monitored or executed
2. **Timing** - When and how often it should run
3. **Duration** - How long it should continue running
4. **Notifications** - What information you want to receive

### Example Automation Requests

Here are some example automations you can create:

#### Price Monitoring
```
"Monitor the price of EGGS token on Base network and notify me every 15 minutes with current price and contract address. I want to track price movements for trading decisions."

Timing: Every 15 minutes
Duration: Run indefinitely
```

#### Portfolio Tracking
```
"Check my Solana wallet balance and token holdings every hour. Alert me if my total portfolio value changes by more than 5% since the last check."

Timing: Every 60 minutes  
Duration: Run for 24 hours
```

#### Trading Alerts
```
"Monitor DEX trading volume for BONK token. If 24h volume exceeds $1M, send me detailed trading statistics and recent price movements."

Timing: Every 30 minutes
Duration: Run for 7 days
```

#### Market Analysis
```
"Track trending tokens on Solana every 2 hours. Find tokens with high social sentiment and growing trading volume, then provide analysis with key metrics."

Timing: Every 120 minutes
Duration: Run indefinitely
```

## Automation Types

### Recurring Automations
- Run continuously at specified intervals (minimum 1 minute)
- Best for ongoing monitoring and regular updates
- Can run indefinitely or for a specified duration

### Delayed One-Time Automations  
- Execute once after a specified delay
- Useful for scheduled actions or reminders
- Automatically disable after execution

### Time-Bounded Automations
- Run for a specific duration then automatically stop
- Good for limited-time monitoring or campaigns
- Can be combined with recurring intervals

## Safety and Limits

### Security Features

- **Isolated Execution**: All automations run in a secure, protected environment
- **No System Access**: Cannot access sensitive system resources
- **Resource Limits**: Controlled memory and processing usage
- **Timeout Protection**: Automatic safeguards prevent runaway processes
- **Validation**: All automations undergo comprehensive security checks

### Execution Limits

- **Minimum Interval**: 1 minute between executions
- **Daily Limit**: Maximum executions per day (system-controlled)
- **Concurrent Tasks**: Limited concurrent automation executions
- **Resource Management**: Automatic resource cleanup and optimization

### Access Control

Currently, automation creation is restricted to authorized users. Contact support if you need access.

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Automation Requests

**Be Specific and Detailed**
```
‚ùå Bad: "Monitor crypto prices"
‚úÖ Good: "Monitor ETH price on Uniswap V3 every 10 minutes and alert me if price moves more than 3% from $2000 baseline"
```

**Include Clear Conditions**
```
‚ùå Bad: "Tell me about my portfolio"  
‚úÖ Good: "Check my portfolio value every hour and notify me only if total value exceeds $10,000 or drops below $5,000"
```

**Specify Notification Preferences**
```
‚ùå Bad: "Let me know what happens"
‚úÖ Good: "Send detailed notifications including current price, 24h change percentage, and trading volume data"
```

### Choosing the Right Timing

- **High-frequency monitoring** (1-5 minutes): Price alerts, urgent notifications
- **Regular updates** (15-60 minutes): Portfolio tracking, market analysis  
- **Periodic summaries** (2-24 hours): Trend analysis, research reports
- **One-time execution**: Scheduled actions, reminders

### Managing Your Automations

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic monitoring before complex strategies
2. **Test Timing**: Use shorter durations initially to verify behavior
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check execution history and adjust if needed
4. **Resource Awareness**: Avoid too many high-frequency automations simultaneously
