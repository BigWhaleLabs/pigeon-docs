# Overview

## What is Pigeon?

Pigeon is the first AI wallet that can talk, code, research, and trade.

Your AI quant for infinite markets—stocks, crypto, perps, and prediction markets. All in one chat.

**The problem**: Markets have never been more interconnected, yet the tools to access them remain siloed. MetaTrader for forex, ThinkOrSwim for stocks, multiple exchanges for crypto, Hyperliquid for perps, Polymarket for predictions. Each demands its own learning curve, API, and mental model.

**Pigeon solves this**: One conversational interface. One unified portfolio view. One AI that understands context across all your positions.

### Supported Markets

- **Prediction markets** via Polymarket
