# Pigeon API

> Build on top of Pigeon's infrastructure

Developers can extend Pigeon's capabilities and integrate its powerful trading infrastructure into their own applications via [api.pigeon.trade](https://api.pigeon.trade).

## What You Can Build

The Pigeon API opens up our multi-agent system to developers who want to:

- **Build Custom Interfaces**: Create your own trading bots, dashboards, or UIs powered by Pigeon's intelligence
- **Integrate Trading into Apps**: Add AI-powered trading capabilities to your existing applications
- **Automate Workflows**: Programmatically interact with Pigeon's full toolkit
- **Create Telegram/Discord Bots**: Build custom bots that leverage Pigeon's trading engine

## How It Works

Our API exposes the same multi-agent system that powers all Pigeon interfaces:

1. **Best-in-Class AI Models**: Access the same reasoning and strategy layer that thinks probabilistically about markets
2. **Deterministic Execution**: When it's time to trade, you get the same reliable runtime with direct protocol integrations
3. **Full Toolkit Access**: All the tools available in chat—swaps, perps, predictions, Pigeon Code—accessible programmatically
