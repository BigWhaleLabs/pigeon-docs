# Best Practices

## Trading Safety

### Always Verify Contract Addresses
Before swapping unfamiliar tokens, verify the contract address shown by Pigeon matches your expectations.

### Set Reasonable Slippage
- **DEX swaps**: 0.5-2%
- **Volatile tokens**: 3-5%
- **Limit orders**: 0% (fills at exact price)

### Gas Management
- Keep native tokens for gas fees
- POL required for Polymarket operations
- SOL required for Solana transactions

## Order Management

### Minimum Order Values
- **Jupiter limit orders**: ~$5 USD
- **Hyperliquid orders**: $10 notional
- **Ostium trades**: $1,500 exposure

### Risk Management
- Use stop losses on leveraged positions
- Don't risk more than you can afford to lose
- Diversify across assets and venues

## Performance Optimization

### Batch Operations
Group multiple swaps/transfers to save on gas fees.

### Timing Considerations
Account for indexing delays when checking balances after transactions.

### Automation Benefits
Use automated tasks for regular monitoring instead of manual checks.
